# CMPS12-Tilt-Compensated-Digital-Compass
This is a CircuitPython library for interacting with the CMPS12 sensor, a tilt-compensated digital compass that utilizes a 3-axis magnetometer, 3-axis gyroscope, and 3-axis accelerometer. The library allows obtaining orientation data (bearing, pitch, roll), temperature, raw sensor data, and calibration status from the sensor via I2C communication.
